# Research

NEBULA (Neurology and Brain Understanding through Learning Algorithms) is a brand new research gruop that combines the power of mathematics and artificial intelligence (AI) to pioneer transformative solutions for neurological disorders. Our team is committed to leveraging the power of mathematical modeling and cutting-edge AI technologies to address the complexities of neurological disorders. By integrating these disciplines, we aim to develop innovative approaches for understanding, diagnosing, and treating conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and others. With a multidisciplinary approach, we strive to push the boundaries of scientific discovery and make meaningful advancements in improving the lives of individuals affected by these challenging conditions. 

Our overarching goal is to explore how mathematical algorithms and natural language techniques can be applied to different mental diseases. Here are some diseases we currently work on:

**Aphasia** Aphasia refers to a language disorder typically caused by brain injury or damage, often resulting from stroke, or the gradual loss of language abilities (Primary Progressive Aphasia, PPA). Individuals with aphasia may have difficulty speaking, understanding speech, reading, and writing. The severity and specific symptoms of aphasia can vary widely depending on the location and extent of brain damage. Treatment often involves speech therapy aimed at improving communication skills and strategies for coping with language difficulties. Our aim is to help both in the detection and the therapy of the disease, using different Natural Language Techniques to automate part of the tasks in order to help therapists and clinicians in their labour.

**Psychosis** Psychosis is a mental state characterized by a disconnection from reality, often marked by hallucinations, delusions, disorganized thinking, and impaired insight. It is not a specific mental disease in itself but can be a symptom of various psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, severe depression with psychotic features, and certain neurological conditions. Hallucinations involve perceiving things that are not present, while delusions are false beliefs held despite evidence to the contrary. Disorganized thinking can manifest as incoherent speech or difficulty organizing thoughts. Impaired insight may lead individuals to not recognize their altered perception of reality. Treatment typically involves a combination of antipsychotic medication, psychotherapy, and support services to manage symptoms and improve functioning. Early intervention and ongoing care are essential for effective management of psychosis and its associated conditions. Different Natural Language Techiques can help enhance identification in the early stage.

**Alzheimer** Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects memory, thinking skills, and behavior, gradually impairing an individual's ability to function independently. While it primarily impacts memory, Alzheimer's can also affect language abilities as the disease progresses. Individuals may experience difficulty finding the right words, understanding spoken or written language, and following conversations. As Alzheimer's advances, communication becomes increasingly challenging, leading to problems with expressing oneself and understanding others. Treatment for Alzheimer's focuses on managing symptoms, preserving cognitive function, and enhancing quality of life through medication, cognitive stimulation, and supportive interventions. However, there is currently no cure for Alzheimer's disease, highlighting the importance of early diagnosis and ongoing support for affected individuals and their families. Our research works towards improving both diagnosis and therapy.
